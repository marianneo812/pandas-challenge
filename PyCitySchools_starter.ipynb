    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "District Summary:\n",
    "There are 15 schools within the district, serving a total of 39,170 students.\n",
    "The total budget across all schools is $24,649,428.00.\n",
    "Average scores indicate students have a stronger performance in math (70.34) compared to reading (69.98).\n",
    "Just over half of the students are passing math (51.46%) and reading (50.81%).\n",
    "The overall passing rate, which could be the average of the two, stands at 51.14%.\n",
    "\n",
    "School Summary:\n",
    "The analysis includes top-performing schools like Holden High School with the highest overall passing rate of 56.32% and larger schools like Bailey High School with an overall passing rate of 53.84%.\n",
    "Smaller and medium-sized schools like Holden High School (427 students) and Pena High School (962 students) tend to have higher overall passing rates compared to larger schools like Rodriguez High School (3999 students).\n",
    "\n",
    "Bottom Performing Schools:\n",
    "Schools with the lowest overall passing rates include Figueroa High School (48.42%), Johnson High School (48.69%), and Hernandez High School (49.36%), all of which have a large student body (2000-5000 students) and higher per-student budgets ($639-$652).\n",
    "\n",
    "Spending Ranges (Per Student):\n",
    "Schools spending less than $585 per student tend to have higher overall passing rates (52.92%) compared to schools that spend more ($645-680), which have the lowest overall passing rates (49.13%).\n",
    "This suggests that higher spending per student does not necessarily correlate with better overall student performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "School Size:\n",
    "Small schools (with less than 1000 students) show the highest overall passing rate of 55.78%, while large schools (2000-5000 students) have the lowest at 50.23%.\n",
    "Medium-sized schools fall in the middle with an overall passing rate of 52.62%.\n",
    "\n",
    "School Type:\n",
    "Independent schools have an overall passing rate of 52.94%, outperforming government schools which have an overall passing rate of 50.43%.\n",
    "Independent schools also have slightly higher average scores in both math and reading compared to government schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusions:\n",
    "1. Smaller school sizes and lower spending per student appear to be associated with higher overall passing rates, suggesting that factors other than budget allocations may significantly influence student performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Independent schools show better performance than government schools, indicating potential differences in educational approaches, resources, or student support mechanisms that could impact student outcomes."
